Stack basically is Abstract Data Structure also known as ADT.  We can perform any Insertion and deletion opertaion in only on top of the Stack.

Stack is working on Last in First out principle.

When we have to insert the element we called as push.

When we have to delete the element we called as pop.

When we have to know the top element in Stack we called the top() Function.

When we have to know the Stack is empty or not we can call the isEmpty() Function.

When we have to know the size of Stack we can call the size() Function.

We can not perform any Insertion , Deletion , Read , Write Or Access opertaion.

In the recursion When we call the Function all the Function call Stored in the call Stack Memory.
