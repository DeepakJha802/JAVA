Time Complexity :- It is a function that tells us how the time is going to groww as the input growws.

Meaning of Big O Notation :- Upper Bound
This Means that it will take atmost time Complexity.
for eg,
O(n) :- This Means that it will take atmost n time Complexity.

Meaning of Big omega Notation :- Lower Bound (it is just opposite to the Big O Notation)
This Means that it will take atleast time Complexity.

for example,
Big omega(n^3) :- This Means that it will take atleast n^3 time Complexity.
