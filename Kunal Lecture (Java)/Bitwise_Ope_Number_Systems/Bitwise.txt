Base two (2) number system means Binary number system. That's means Zero's (0) and One's (1).

1. When we do AND(&) Operation of any number with one(1) , number will remain the same.
2. When we do XOR(^) Operation of any number with one(1) , then we are getting the compliment of that number.
3. When we do XOR(^) Operation of any number with Zero(0) , then we are getting the same number.
4. When we do XOR(^) Operation of any number with itself , then we are getting the Zero.
5. When we shift left a number A , B times , then we getting (a * (2 ^ b)).
6. When we shift right a number A , B times , then we getting (a / (2 ^ b)).
7.
