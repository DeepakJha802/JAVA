We have to treat recurison problem as Principle of Mathematical Induction (PMI).

like,

If F(n) is true for all natural nos.

1. Base case :- F(0) & F(1) is true.
2. Induction Hypothesis :- Assume that F(k) is true
3. Induction Step :- Using Step 2 Prove that F(k + 1) is true.

## Another Extended form of Principle of Mathematical Induction(PMI)..

1. Base case :- Prove F(0) or F(1) is true.
2. Induction Hypothesis :- Assume F(i) is true for all i <= k
3. Induction Step :- Using Step 2 Prove F(k + 1) is true.
