Takeing input in java

1. there are multiple way to take input in java but now we talking about scanner
because scanner is a easyer way to take input now,
for take input we have first to creat a scanner
now to creat a scanner --
    Scanner s = Scanner(System.in);
        here we want scanner to fetch input fron the input string so this is why we writeing system.in
        also we have to add package. where scanner is present (i.e (import java.util.Scanner)).
        here ,
        java.util -- this is a package
        .Scanner -- this is class
        Package is a collection of classes and class is a collection of objects.
int a = s.nextInt(); // this is how we can take input from user.
int b = s.nextInt();
char ch = s.nextChar();
double d = s.nextDouble();
short sh = s.nextShort();
long l = s.nextLong();
String str = s.next(); // for fetch 1st word only.
String str = s.nextLine(); // for fetch the entire line.
char ch = str.CharAt(0); // to fetch the first alphabet of word from the string.
